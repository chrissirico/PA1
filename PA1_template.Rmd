```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.retina = 4, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
activity <- readr::read_csv("activity.csv") # read in data as tibble

# "steps" is number of steps measured in that interval
# "data" is the date in form YYYY-MM-DD
# "interval" has minutes in the rightmost digits and hours in leftmost digits

```
I'm just gonna save and push this baby one time so I have an original commit. I'll come back and do something meaningful later.
